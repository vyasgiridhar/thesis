\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}

The understanding of the matrix profile, and its computation, is fundamental to the
design of the underlying work. We briefly introduce the reader to concepts related to
matrix profiles and their efficient computation, which are the basis for the formulations
deployed on the Cerberas accelerator. Time series data mining, as data processing applications in
general, greatly profits from streaming abstractions and the ability to express data
transformations on a high level. We, therefore, employ a weak scaling approach to mapping the developed algorithm to a concrete hardware design running
on the Cerebras accelerator. As the corresponding programming model is relatively novel and
constitutes the basis of the introduced design and its subsequent implementation,
the reader is introduced to fundamental concepts of the Accelerator and its abstractions. These
concepts prove essential to address the complexities of the design while allowing the
problem to be structured effectively.
This chapter is split into two parts: first, the reader is introduced to the concept
(and required notation) of a matrix profile and an algorithm (SCAMP) for its efficient
computation; secondly, the chapter establishes fundamentals related to the target device, which make up the basic building blocks for the presented design and its implementation.
